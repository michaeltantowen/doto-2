                    Doto 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players
                    compete
                    tcollectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst
                    defendintheir own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time
                    strategy controls, anis presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. Ten
                    players each control one of thgame's 121 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having
                    their
                    own design, strengths, and weaknesseHeroes are divided into 9 primary roles.

                <p class="sub-desc">
                    Abilities are unique skills that heroes and creeps have access to on the battlefield. They range
                    from
                    simple passive effects, to devastating explosions of energy, to complex, terrain changing feats. All
                    heroes have four or more abilities, three or more basic abilities and an ultimate ability, that they
                    can
                    assign ability points to every time they level up. Every level in an ability makes it more powerful,
                    sometimes increasing its mana cost as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Abilities can consume mana, and may also be placed on cooldown when used. Abilities that are on
                    cooldown
                    cannot be used until their cooldown timer is up, at which point they can be cast again. Abilities
                    with
                    low cooldowns are sometimes referred to as "spammable" abilities, because they can be used very
                    frequently.

                    Ultimates, unlike normal abilities, are usually able to target a unit under a spell immunity effect,
                    such as Black King Bar. They will rarely damage such a unit, but other effects such as slows or stun
                    will usually apply. This makes ultimates, especially those with stun effects, incredibly powerful,
                    since enemy heroes cannot block the effects.

                    Many abilities come together with sub-abilities. These extra abilities usually do nothing on their
                    own and mostly are only active after the spell they come with was cast first, or in some cases, they
                    serve as a set-up for other spells. Their tasks range from activating the effects of other abilities
                    on demand, manipulate abilities or even fully cancel them when desired. Usually, these abilities are
                    innate, or are unlocked after learning specific spells. Since these abilities usually have a very
                    low or no cooldown at all, they usually do not trigger abilities which react on ability usage, like
                    Magic Wand's charge gain or Arcane Curse's spell cast penalty.

                <p class="sub-desc">
                    Some abilities (basic and ultimate abilities) do not use the cooldown system, but instead have a
                    number of charges and no cooldown. Each cast of such a spell consumes one of its charges, which then
                    replenishes over time.

                        Every time a hero levels up, they earn an ability point, until their abilities are fully
                        upgraded.
                        The player can then spend the point to unlock one of the hero's abilities, or to upgrade an
                        already
                        learned ability. At the start of the game, all of a hero's abilities are locked, but they each
                        start
                        with one ability point which can be used at any time. Abilities cannot be used and do not have
                        any
                        effect if they are still locked. After an ability is unlocked, it can be upgraded several times.
                        Basic abilities can be upgraded 3 more times, for a total of 4 levels, and a hero's ultimate
                        ability
                        can be upgraded 2 times, for a total of 3 levels.
                        <br><br>
                        The exception to this is Invoker, who can upgrade his basic abilities 6 times (total of 7
                        levels).
                        <br><br>
                        Upgrading abilities will make them more effective. Depending on the ability, upgrading the
                        ability
                        may increase the amount of damage, increase the duration of an ongoing effect such as a disable,
                        or
                        otherwise improve the ability.
                        <br><br>
                        Sometimes, upgrading abilities will also increase or decrease the mana cost. For example, each
                        level
                        in Earthshaker's Fissure increases the damage it deals and the duration of its stun, but also
                        increases its mana cost.
                        <br><br>
                        Besides directly leveling abilities, there are a few other ways to make abilities more powerful.
                        Spell Amplification is a mechanic which increases the amount of damage of abilities slightly.
                        Aghanim's Scepter and Aghanim's Shard are special items which can enhance each hero in a unique
                        way.
                        Depending on the hero, it may enhance the power of their ultimate ability, improve one or more
                        basic
                        abilities, or in some cases, Aghanim's Scepter or Aghanim's Shard even grants an entire new
                        ability.
                        <br><br>
                        Some heroes also have an ability which improves their other abilities further. For example, Ogre
                        Magi's Multicast makes his other 3 abilities more powerful.
                    </p>
                        Active abilities are indicated by a bevel around the icon, which makes them look like a button.
                        When an ability gets used and enters its cast animation, the bevel turns green and the icon
                        shifts, looking like a pressed button. When selecting a targeted ability, the icon and the bevel
                        appear brighter until the ability gets deselected or the cast begins. Active abilities also have
                        a hotkey displayed at the top left corner.
                    </p>

                    <li class="sub-desc">Passive</li>
                    <p class="sub-desc">
                        Passive abilities apply their effects either permanently as soon as they are learned, or
                        activate by themselves if the ability is learned and its requirements met. These requirements
                        can range from attacking a unit, casting a spell or even getting attacked. Most passive
                        abilities do not consume mana and usually do not have cooldowns, exceptions include Wraith King
                        and Reincarnation. Most heroes have at least one passive ability, though not all do.
                        <br><br>
                        Passive abilities do not have a bevel and look like they are pressed into the hud. Since passive
                        abilities cannot be used manually, their appearance never changes. Passive abilities only have
                        an icon displayed upon learning.

                        Basic abilities can be upgraded to a new level once every 2 levels. This means that a level 2
                        hero
                        cannot upgrade a learned basic ability to level 2. Every 2 levels, a hero increases his maximum
                        basic ability level by 1. Ultimate abilities can only be upgraded every 6 levels, starting from
                        level 6. These ultimate abilities are usually more powerful than a hero's basic abilities.

                        A hero's last ability, which can usually be trained at level 6, level 12, and level 18, is
                        called an
                        ultimate. There is only one exception to this level restriction: Meepo's Divided We Stand, which
                        can
                        instead be upgraded at levels 4, 11, and 18.

                        Ultimates can be high-impact abilities that define a hero's strengths and playstyle; they often
                        have
                        a devastating effect and a long cooldown. In some cases however, they are not the main strength,
                        but
                        just synergize very well when combined with the other abilities. Some ultimates have a lower
                        effect
                        but are spammable due to a relatively short cooldown. Ultimate abilities can also be passive

                        stun

                        powerful,
                        since enemy heroes cannot block the effects.

                        They usually affect the caster, or units around the caster. They can affect an area around the

                            Toggle abilities are always non-targetable. These abilities apply a periodic effect and

                            damaging or healing nearby allies, to switch between attack types, and to manipulate other
                            abilities of the unit. If the toggle ability drains mana over time, it turns itself off once
                            not having mana to support it anymore. They cannot be forcibly turned off by anyone but the
                            player by pressing their button again, or by dying. Like regular spells, they cannot be used
                            (in this case, turned on or off) while affected by disables which prevent ability usage.
                            However, once they are toggled on, they persist through any form of disable, including

                        they
                        serve as a set-up for other spells. Their tasks range from activating the effects of other
                        abilities
                        on demand, manipulate abilities or even fully cancel them when desired. Usually, these abilities
                        are
                        innate, or are unlocked after learning specific spells. Since these abilities usually have a
                        very
                        low or no cooldown at all, they usually do not trigger abilities which react on ability usage,
                        like
                        Magic Wand's charge gain or Arcane Curse's spell cast penalty.

                            Active abilities must be used in order to apply their effects. Active abilities can consume
                            mana, have cooldowns, and usually have some method of targeting related to them. The
                            majority of
                            abilities are active abilities. They can be activated by pressing their associated Hotkey.

                            If an ability can target the caster, ↓↓ Double-tapping the Hotkey causes them to activate

                            Active abilities are indicated by a bevel around the icon, which makes them look like a

                            When an ability gets used and enters its cast animation, the bevel turns green and the icon
                            shifts, looking like a pressed button. When selecting a targeted ability, the icon and the
                            bevel
                            appear brighter until the ability gets deselected or the cast begins. Active abilities also
                            have
                            a hotkey displayed at the top left corner.

                            activate by themselves if the ability is learned and its requirements met. These
                            requirements
                            can range from attacking a unit, casting a spell or even getting attacked. Most passive
                            abilities do not consume mana and usually do not have cooldowns, exceptions include Wraith
                            King

                            Disables such as silences and stuns do not prevent a unit from toggling its autocast
                            abilities on or off. However, autocast abilities cannot be used when silenced as with all
                            other spells. Most auto-castable spells are active attack modifiers, applying a modification
                            to the user's attacks when activated. When toggled on, the ability will apply whenever
                            possible. For example, Drow Ranger Frost Arrows will be used whenever she attacks a target.
                            When toggled off, they will not be used and will not consume mana. When an active attack
                            modifier is manually cast, it is partially treated as a spell cast instead of as an attack.
                            This causes nearby enemy creeps to not aggro when using them that way. This is also known as
                            orb walking.
                            <br><br>
                            Not all abilities with autocast are attack modifiers. A few of them are regular abilities,
                            which, when toggled on, will automatically be cast when their requirements are met. An
                            example of such is Ogre Magi Bloodlust. When toggled on, Ogre Magi will automatically cast
                            Bloodlust on nearby allied heroes.

                            The autocast on Devour does not make Doom cast Devour automatically. Instead, the toggle
                            state determines whether Doom will copy the target neutral creep's abilities or not. When
                            toggled off, Doom does not acquire new neutral creep spells. When toggled on, he does.

                            Auto-castable abilities have almost the same appearance as regular active abilities. They
                            also have a bevel which turns white when selected and green when casting. However, they do
                            not turn green for attack modifiers. On top of that, they have a thicker second bevel behind
                            the first bevel. This one glows orange when the ability gets set to autocast.

                            or a point. They usually affect the caster, or units around the caster. They can affect an

                                Toggle abilities are always non-targetable. These abilities apply a periodic effect and
                                often drain mana or health as long as they are toggled on. These effects can range from
                                damaging or healing nearby allies, to switch between attack types, and to manipulate
                                other abilities of the unit. If the toggle ability drains mana over time, it turns
                                itself off once not having mana to support it anymore. They cannot be forcibly turned
                                off by anyone but the player by pressing their button again, or by dying. Like regular
                                spells, they cannot be used (in this case, turned on or off) while affected by disables
                                which prevent ability usage. However, once they are toggled on, they persist through any

                            For some abilities, it merely determines the direction to launch an effect, for other

                            until it gets in cast range or the target cannot be targeted anymore (e.g. the target turns

                        Creeps are basic units in Doto 2. Every unit which is not a hero, building, ward or courier is
                        considered a creep. Creeps can belong to either faction, be neutral, or be player-controlled
                        units. Unlike heroes, creeps do not gain experience and cannot level up. All of their stats are
                        set values (though can still be altered by modifiers). Most creeps grant a set gold and
                        experience bounty to heroes when killed.

                    Buildings are a type unit that are not controlled by any player. At the beginning of each match, a
                    set
                    of buildings spawn at set locations for both teams. Both factions have the same set of buildings,
                    with
                    only their appearance differing from each other. Buildings take mostly defensive roles and are the
                    main
                    objective of the game.
                    <br><br>
                    All buildings have the same base properties. They are immune to most spells (with only a few spells
                    affecting them), have the structure armor type, deal siege damage if they can attack and are
                    immobile.
                    When destroyed, some buildings grant gold to the entire enemy team, while others grant gold only to
                    whoever made the last hit. Once below 10% health, buildings (except for the Ancients) can be denied
                    to
                    prevent the enemy from getting their gold bounties, or to reduce the amount they get. Buildings do
                    not
                    grant experience. Once destroyed, a building is permanently lost, as they do not respawn.
                    <br><br>
                    There are a total of 29 buildings on each side.

                        is a building within the base). The creep must not be dominated by a player, only AI-controlled
                        lane
                        creeps can deactivate the protection. Once deactivated, it takes some time for the protection to
                        activate again.
                        <br><br>
                        There are 4 separate disable areas of Backdoor protection. Each tier 2 tower has its own
                        circular
                        area centered on them, providing protection to themselves, and the ancient has a gigantic
                        circular
                        area centered on it, providing protection to all buildings inside the base (except the
                        fountain).
                        This means each of the tier 2 towers have independent protections, meaning when one is disabled,
                        the
                        others are not disabled. They are also independent from the base protection. Meanwhile, all
                        buildings inside the base share one protection and lose it simultaneously when disabled. The
                        radius
                        of the Ancient's disable area is so huge that it goes beyond the elevated base area. On the Dire
                        side, it reaches up until halfway between the top tier 2 tower and the top base ramp, up to the
                        mid
                        tier 2 tower and up until just shy of the ward spot next to the bottom tier 2 tower. On the
                        Radiant
                        side, it reaches behind the top tier 2 tower, beyond the mid tier 2 tower and halfway between
                        the
                        bottom tier 2 tower and the bottom base ramp.

                        Backdoor protection is not responsible for the invulnerability buildings have, so the buildings
                        still stay invulnerable if their corresponding towers are not destroyed first.

                        Barracks (commonly shortened to Rax or Racks) are buildings, defended by their tier 3 towers,
                        that
                        are responsible for keeping lane creeps as powerful as their counterparts. There are two
                        Barracks
                        for each lane per faction - one for melee creeps (called Melee Barracks or Melee Rax), and one
                        for
                        ranged creeps (called Ranged Barracks or Ranged Rax). The ranged barracks are always located to
                        the
                        left of the melee barracks on each lane and both factions.
                        <br><br>
                        Barracks are invulnerable until the tier 3 tower guarding them is destroyed. The loss of
                        barracks
                        does not stop lane creeps from spawning. However, destroying Barracks grants the destroying team
                        super creeps in that lane, corresponding to which one was destroyed, which are more powerful and
                        grant less bounties than regular creeps. Super melee creeps spawn when the melee barracks get
                        destroyed, while super ranged creeps spawn when the ranged barracks are destroyed. When all 6
                        Barracks of a team are destroyed, mega creeps start spawning on every lane for the enemy, even
                        more
                        powerful than super creeps.

                        Fountains are buildings located in the respawn areas of both bases, and provide scaling health

                        mana regeneration to all allied units near it. They also greatly defend the spawn area, blasting

                        towers, except that they cannot be aggroed immediately by attacking an enemy hero. Fountains are

                            Damage can be dealt by attacks, abilities and items. Attack damage is the damage dealt per
                            attack, and is displayed on the sword icon in the HUD. Heroes start off with a basic damage
                            plus
                            1 extra damage per point of primary attribute. As heroes level up, they gain primary
                            attributes
                            and therefore gain damage. Items that grant increased "Damage" increase attack damage, and

                                also
                                not amplified by magical damage amplification abilities, fully ignores Armor and Damage
                                Block.It does not affect invulnerable units.

                                There are a few sources that can manipulate Pure Damage, with Dispersion is one of them.
                                Pure damage affects units with Spell Immunity (because spell immunity does not block
                                damage), but that does not mean that an ability that deals pure damage is able to target
                                spell immune units.
                                <br><br>
                                For example, Laser deals pure damage, but cannot be cast on units with spell immunity.

                            Several abilities have certain flags that cause them to behave differently in certain
                            situations.There are 2 different flags: The HP Removal flag and the No-reflection flag. All
                            spells can be flagged, regardless of what damage type they use.

                                Spells flagged as HP Removal fully ignore any form of damage manipulation (with a few
                                exceptions listed below), means they cannot be amplified, reduced or blocked except by
                                magic
                                resistance and magical damage barriers in case of magical damage and armor in case of
                                physical damage,which is also reduced by damage block. They also ignore and do not
                                trigger
                                any on-damage effects, making them unable to cancel consumables for example. Most spells
                                flagged as HP Removal deal pure damage. The HP Removal flag also causes damage to ignore
                                invulnerability, however, this is not always the case. Even when flagged, the damage is
                                still registered as such and may be counted by statistics as damage.
                                <br><br>
                                Note: Not all source of health loss are damage. Several abilities which reduce a unit's
                                health without triggering on-damage effects do so by directly setting a unit's health to
                                specific values. Unlike damage with the HP removal flag, these health manipulation truly
                                bypass any on-damage effect and are not registered as damage at all. For more details,

                                The no-reflection flag causes several on-damage events not to interact with the damage

                                spells which have the no-reflection flag. This is to prevent infinite damage loops (for
                                example 2 opposing heroes with Blade Mail).

                            Besides damage, a unit may also be killed with the instant kill mechanic, without the actual

                            of damage. Similar to HP Removal, instant killing effects ignore almost everything and can

                            be prevented by a few spells.

                        Attack damage is the amount of damage a unit is shown to deal with a regular attack. A unit's
                        total
                        attack damage is the sum of its main attack damage (white) and bonus attack damage (green).
                        Attack
                        damage is modified by many different effects in the game and ends up going through a number of
                        steps
                        in order to determine how much damage an attack actually deals as its overall or total attack
                        damage.

                            values.
                            Total attack damage is synonymous with how much health a target immediately loses as a
                            direct
                            result of the attack. Some on-hit effects that are not affected by critical strike are still
                            considered part of attack damage, and some are not.

                                game. It consists of two values, a minimum and maximum amount. Every time an attack is
                                issued, a random value between these two extremes is chosen to help decide the damage
                                output. The most extreme hero example of this is Chaos Knight, with base attack damage
                                ranging between 29 and 59, causing his damage output to be somewhat unpredictable (or at
                                least much less predictable than other heroes). This range of 30 is always part of his
                                attack calculations, no matter how many attributes or how much bonus attack damage he
                                acquires.

                            instant
                            damage to the target unit(s) or area. Instant Attacks do not use the hero's attack
                            animation,
                            are independent from attack speed, and ignores the regular downtime between attacks. Certain
                            abilities that deal instant attack damage are not affected by evasion. If an instant attack
                            is
                            performed by a ranged hero, it still uses their regular attack projectile for the attack,
                            unless
                            it is set not to.
                            <br><br>
                            If an instant attack occurs while already attacking an enemy normally, it does not interfere
                            with the regular attack. They do not interfere with any other actions of the hero either,
                            meaning they do not interrupt movement, do not cancel spell casts and do not stop channeling
                            spells of the hero.
                            <br><br>
                            Since instant attacks do not use attack animations and jump straight to the attack point,
                            they
                            cannot proc effects which react on the start of an attack, like Untouchable or Moment of
                            Courage. However, they can proc effects which react on attack hit, such as Counter Helix and
                            Retaliate, although there are some exceptions to this. Instant attacks may proc on-hit
                            effects
                            only when they are allowed to. An instant attack which is not allowed to proc attack
                            modifiers
                            is not allowed to proc on-hit effects either. Just like regular attacks, instant attacks
                            also
                            cause the attacking hero to get revealed if attacking from the Fog of War.

                        Spell damage is all damage which is not dealt by physical attacks. This includes all spells
                        which
                        deal magical, physical or pure damage, as well as all items with abilities that deal damage.
                        Even
                        the damage dealt by attack modifiers counts as spell damage, as long as the effect deals its
                        damage
                        in a separate instance from the attack damage.

                        Magic spell damage is influenced by magic resistance, physical spell damage is influenced by

                        and pure damage is not affected by either. All three underlie damage manipulation.

                        Damage manipulation is a mechanic that alters damage values, either increasing or reducing it.
                        Damage can be manipulated on both ends, from the dealing unit (outgoing damage) and the
                        receiving
                        unit (incoming damage). Armor and magic resistance are the most common damage manipulators,
                        affecting incoming physical and magical damage respectively. Besides armor and magic resistance,
                        a
                        general damage manipulator exists, which is used by almost all other sources of damage
                        manipulation.
                        This manipulator is more flexible, and can amplify or reduce any kind of damage and may affect
                        attack damage, spell damage, or both at the same time.

                            Many source of damage manipulations have conditions on them like Bristleback where it has
                            damage
                            manipulation only on damage that hits his back or sides, so each damage instance calculates
                            damage manipulation separately. Additionally, outgoing generic damage manipulators do not
                            apply
                            to damage that is Unaffected by Amplification.
                            Stacking outgoing damage manipulation stacks in the same way as incoming damage
                            manipulation,
                            i.e. additively. However, since incoming and outgoing manipulations happen at different
                            times
                            with outgoing manipulation calculation happening first, they stack multiplicatively with

                            Many abilities react on damage a unit receives. In some cases, fully negating the damage
                            causes
                            them to not proc. However, some on-damage effects also react on 0 damage so they still may
                            proc
                            even when the proccing damage got negated.

                            Minimum Health, just like regular damage negation, prevents a unit from dying. However, the
                            way in which that is achieved is completely different. Instead of directly reducing or
                            negating damage, this mechanic rather manipulates the health of the unit.The
                            MODIFIER_PROPERTY_MIN_HEALTH property prevents a unit's health from dropping below the value
                            it is set to. It does not affect the damage itself, meaning on-damage effects react on the
                            full damage, and not how much damage was dealt effectively, so they can be triggered
                            normally.

                        Damage over time (DoT) is a condition that causes the affected unit to constantly take damage
                        until
                        the effect expires, is dispelled, or the target moves out of range. Damage is dealt at the end
                        of
                        each interval, the first of which begins when the spell lands. Some spells come with an initial
                        damage, which may or may not be equal to the periodic damage.

                        All spells require the casting unit to spend a certain amount of time before the spell's effects
                        are
                        applied. This time window is known as cast point or cast time. Only once the unit reaches this
                        point
                        does the spell take effect. The length of the cast time can vary heavily and is set for each
                        spell
                        individually. Usually, a specific unit's spells share the same cast point.
                        <br><br>
                        Losing vision of target cancels cast animation.
                        <br><br>
                        An ability only applies its effects, goes on cooldown and expends mana when the casting unit
                        successfully reaches the cast point of the spell. This means when the unit gets interrupted by
                        disables or their own actions before reaching the cast point of the spell, the cast gets
                        canceled,
                        the spell's effects do not get applied, it won't go into cooldown and won't draw mana. The
                        player
                        also can manually stop the spell cast by issuing a stop or halt command. When the spell cast
                        gets
                        interrupted during the cast time, the visual cast animation ends as well.

                    <p class="sub-desc">
                        If the channeling unit is issued another command, such as to move, stop, or attack, the unit
                        will
                        disrupt the channeled ability. Casting other spells or using items will also interrupt
                        channeling,
                        with the exception of toggled abilities, Wind Walk abilities, a few other abilities like Blade
                        Fury,
                        and the items below.
                        <br><br>
                        The only items that may be activated while channeling are Armlet of Mordiggian, Glimmer Cape,
                        Mask
                        of Madness, Observer and Sentry Wards (switching only), Phase Boots, Radiance, Shadow Amulet,
                        Shadow
                        Blade, Shiva's Guard, and Silver Edge. Note that even though these items do not interrupt
                        channelings upon cast, their effects after cast (like self-silence) may still interrupt the
                        channeling. Activating any other item will interrupt channeling.
                        <br><br>
                        Any disable that would normally prevent a unit from casting the spell in question will also
                        interrupt channeling. This includes stuns, cyclones, hexes, sleeps, and getting hidden. Though
                        they
                        do not prevent casting, most root effects will also interrupt channeling. Silence will interrupt
                        channeling from abilities only, while mute will interrupt channeling from items. Some abilities
                        that
                        forcibly move units, such as Vacuum or X Marks the Spot (the first applies a ministun while
                        moving
                        units, and the second one is like an uncontrollable blink), will interrupt channeling as well,
                        even
                        if used on friendly units; however, other abilities like Force Staff and Boulder Smash, will not
                        interrupt channeling, apply forced movement and not causing an interrupt state.
                        <br><br>
                        If the channel is interrupted before the spell's effects occur, the mana and cooldown will be
                        wasted, and the spell's effect will be cut short, and in some cases will not perform their
                        effects
                        at all. This is in contrast to other, non-channeled spells with high cast times, such as
                        Assassinate
                        and Requiem of Souls, which will not expend mana or go on cooldown until the spell has been
                        completed. Certain channeled spells, such as Illuminate and Powershot, will still perform their
                        effect even if they are canceled, usually at the cost of damage.

                    Items are in-game equipment that provide heroes with bonus attributes and special abilities. Most
                    items
                    can be purchased from several shops on the game map, while others are dropped by creeps. Lower tier
                    items are combined into higher tier items, usually with the help of a recipe. Heroes have six item
                    slots
                    in their inventory, three in their backpack, and six more in their stash. Items can be picked up and
                    delivered to their owner with a courier.

                    The heroes in Doto 2 are defined by the roles that they are suited to play as a combination of their
                    attributes, abilities, and items, and the ways that these shape the game. Although the abilities of
                    heroes may suit a variety of purposes and can be used in a variety of ways in different situations,
                    roles nonetheless exist to define the playstyle a hero is expected to conform to, as well as the
                    actions
                    they are meant to perform within a game.
                    <br><br>
                    The attributes of heroes (their essential statistics and their basic combat ability) and the varying
                    nature and effects of their abilities all serve to provide much distinction between heroes, giving
                    them
                    each tactical advantages and disadvantages at various locations, situations, and times within the
                    game
                    that have to be understood well for success. As strategic combat between two teams of five heroes
                    with
                    distinctly different abilities and strengths is the central conflict of Doto 2; players need to be
                    well
                    informed of their role within each team, as well as the roles of the enemy heroes. Even more
                    importantly, players should keep in mind how their ability build and item build affects their heroes
                    and
                    fares against the ability and item builds of enemy heroes in the context of every single game so
                    that
                    they make sound decisions on the abilities and items that they choose to get.

                            Carries are the heroes that can obtain the greatest offensive power as the game progresses,
                            the
                            name so derived from the act being "carried" by a team into the late game; that is, to
                            eventually bear the responsibility for ultimate victory. They tend to become extremely
                            powerful
                            later in the game relative to other heroes once they amass substantial levels and items.
                            Once
                            farmed, they are very good at killing opponents, though some carries such as Naga Siren tend
                            to
                            attain victory through their ability to destroy enemy structures rather than kill enemy
                            heroes.
                            Carries typically lack early game power, but must be powerful by the late game; thus, the
                            items
                            they carry are an essential part of their build. Most carries rely on right-clicking, using
                            their inherent attack power (usually augmented by abilities) to overwhelm their enemies.
                            Carries
                            tend to have high base movement speed.
                            <br><br>
                            Although they are the powerhouses of the late game, they are relatively weak in the early
                            game,
                            as their abilities tend not to be very useful at low levels. Many "hard" carries, that is,
                            carries that are extremely reliant on items to function (though benefit most from them) will
                            need to farm almost incessantly prior to around 30-40 minutes into the game. They should not
                            ever participate in early skirmishes unless they can assist without endangering themselves
                            (for
                            example, Spectre can use her Haunt ability to help her team's damage without ever actually
                            being
                            in danger). This can and often does mean that their team is forced to progress through much
                            of
                            the game without their help, during which time a team's semi-carry (usually the solo mid)
                            will
                            perform the role of carry, as the early to mid game is a semi-carries period of maximum
                            relative
                            power.
                            <br><br>
                            There are carries of all three primary attributes, although the hardest carries are almost
                            entirely agility. Strength carries (such as Alchemist, Dragon Knight, Wraith King, and
                            Lifestealer) typically rely on sustained damage and their own durability to carry, as well
                            as
                            some decent disables. Their weakness tends to be low armor (though there are some notable
                            exceptions) and because they are almost invariably melee, they can often be kited easily
                            (kiting
                            being a process of staying too far away from an enemy for them to attack you; as if the
                            enemy is
                            being strung along like a kite). Agility carries (such as Luna, Faceless Void, and Phantom
                            Assassin) tend to inflict substantial damage in rapid successions, and have very high limits
                            where damage infliction is concerned. Agility carries tend to be ranged but many are melee.
                            Their weakness tends to be an inability to do anything effectively except inflict damage -
                            they
                            generally have minimal utility and are quite fragile, though there are exceptions to both.
                            Intelligence carries (such as Storm Spirit, Nature's Prophet, and Outworld Destroyer)
                            usually
                            rely on their abilities and active use of items to carry, but their physical damage is often
                            respectable too. They are invariably ranged heroes owing to their frailty, but their
                            powerful
                            abilities mean that they are often difficult to kill. They tend to struggle against enemies
                            with
                            spell immunity.
                            <br><br>
                            Some carries with long-cooldown, teamfight-oriented ultimates, such as Naga Siren, Luna, and
                            Outworld Destroyer require constant team support all throughout the game, whereas other
                            carries
                            such as Phantom Assassin or Lifestealer are suited to tackling many enemies in succession
                            and
                            rely much less on their team (but suffer from a lack of AoE abilities). Essentially, while
                            some
                            carries are suited to solo encounters and ganks, others are most at home in a large clash.
                            <br><br>
                            Carries typically are relegated to a side lane early on with one or more support heroes to
                            babysit them until they collect the necessary items to farm independently, while a select
                            few
                            carry heroes, most notably Shadow Fiend, can easily undertake a solo midlane role throughout
                            the
                            majority of the game. There are some cases where carries ended up in solo safe lane (Radiant
                            Bottom, Dire Top) if the team opted to run an aggressive tri-lane at the suicide lane
                            (Radiant
                            Top, Dire Bottom).
                            <br><br>
                            A rule of carries is that the more farm a carry requires to be effective, the more power
                            they
                            can attain relative to other carries. The term "out-carrying" refers to one hero's
                            capability to
                            carry harder than another - that is, to have more potential power to carry than another
                            hero.
                            Carries come in all shapes and sizes, and while some require little farm to begin carrying
                            quite
                            early in the game, they can (and usually will) be out-carried by a "harder" carry than
                            themselves if that carry is given the chance to amass the gold and items they require.

                            Supports are heroes whose purpose is to keep their allies alive and give them opportunities
                            to
                            earn more gold and experience. Supports usually come with helpful abilities for their team,
                            such
                            as healing spells or abilities that disable enemies; and generally are more centered around
                            utility than damage (although they can often inflict huge amounts of damage in the right
                            situation). Supports are not very dependent on items, and generally only purchase one or two
                            items for their personal usage - the rest of their gold is to be spent on items for the
                            benefit
                            of the team such as Animal Courier, Observer Ward, Sentry Ward, and Smoke of Deceit.
                            <br><br>
                            Supports are typically paired with the team's carry at the start of a game. This is because
                            the
                            carry tends to be the weakest and most gold-hungry member of the team early on, whereas
                            support
                            heroes are at their strongest in the early game. Supports should always try to forfeit kills
                            to
                            any teammate who is more reliant on items than they are, only performing a kill if none of
                            their
                            allies is able to do it.

                            Nukers are heroes with fast, strong, and/or sustainable spell or magical damage output,
                            whether
                            it be through single-target spells or area-of-effect ones. Because area of effect damage
                            comes
                            mainly from nukes, Nukers can provide a huge damage-per-second advantage in team fights when
                            they can harm multiple enemy heroes all at once. Area of effect nukers also excel at pushing
                            as
                            they can dispatch enemy creeps efficiently. Burst damage nukers such as Lina can also be
                            deadly,
                            as one single fast combo of her spells can often kill or grievously wound an enemy hero
                            immediately before any reaction, thereby making a teamfight one-sided from the start. The
                            mana
                            cost and cooldowns of nukes often dictate how they will be used, as ones with low mana cost
                            and/or cooldown can be spammed in lanes or in ganks, while ones with higher mana cost and
                            cooldown are often best saved for large confrontations.

                            exceptional. Heroes with powerful disables tend to have low base movement speed, giving

                            from solo farm instead of one. Junglers typically have abilities that allow them to convert
                            neutral creeps, summon minions, or sustain themselves through moderate damage from jungle
                            creeps. The ability to jungle is found in heroes of all attribute classes and roles.

                            standard
                            because their primary attribute, strength, also grants health, although heroes of any

                            teleportation (such as Blinking), and evasion. Many carry heroes also have escape mechanisms
                            to
                            give them the survivability they need to continue farming and killing.

                            Pushers are heroes who focus on bringing down towers quickly, thereby acquiring map control.
                            If
                            they succeed, they often shut down the enemy carry by forcing them away from farming areas.
                            They
                            typically have abilities that fortify allied creep waves, harm multiple enemy creeps and/or
                            heroes at once, summon minions, or deal massive amounts of damage to enemy towers.

                            Initiators are heroes who can safely and advantageously start a team fight. These heroes
                            typically have strong area of effect damage or disable or some ability to affect the
                            positioning
                            of the enemy team. Many of these heroes rely completely on a positional item such as Blink
                            Dagger or Force Staff to get the proper positioning to initiate a teamfight, while a select
                            few,
                            such as Elder Titan and Silencer, do not require this asset. Although it is common for an
                            Initiator to be a Durable hero, this is not always the case; fragile heroes such as Enigma
                            and
                            Vengeful Spirit are adept at initiation. Late in the game, this role becomes very crucial,
                            as an
                            effective initiation can win a teamfight, and a poor one can lose it.

                            The term "hard carry" refers to a type of carry hero who is especially reliant on the
                            acquisition of items to function effectively, as opposed to "softer" carries that gain
                            substantial damage from abilities and as such do not require gold to be dangerous. Hard
                            carries
                            are generally equipped with abilities which scale very closely with their items, meaning
                            that
                            when they do not have farm their abilities are weak. Hard carries cannot have farm early in
                            the
                            game, so they are generally paired in lanes with disabling support heroes, whose powerful
                            early
                            game abilities counterbalance the horribly weak hard carry's. As a hard carry attains gold
                            and
                            levels, they will progressively become more dangerous, and generally reach their period of
                            maximum relative effectiveness later in the game than other heroes - meaning that the hard
                            carry
                            will have a huge advantage if the game goes for long enough. As a rule, the more reliant a
                            carry
                            is on items to function directly correlates with how effective they are once they have them
                            -
                            for instance, Anti-Mage with three carry items in his inventory will be stronger than a
                            Medusa
                            with the same amount, but when six items are in play, Medusa will make much better use of
                            them
                            than Anti-Mage - this means that she is a harder carry than he.

                            Semi-carries are heroes that, like hard carries, are skilled at killing enemy heroes. Unlike
                            hard carries, however, they do not require very much farm to do so, and are generally most
                            dependent on levels, so they usually lane in the middle lane to amass them as rapidly as
                            possible. They tend to be most dominant in the midgame, before either their own or the
                            enemy's
                            true carry has amassed enough farm to supersede them. A successful game for a semi-carry
                            involves asserting map control and impeding the enemy carry's farm, which in turn allows for
                            their own carry to safely amass items. The "semi-carry", although long acknowledged in the
                            community, is not a role recognized by Valve, likely because of the high ambiguity in
                            defining
                            the role.
                            <br><br>
                            If they are doing well, a semi-carry may have respectable attack damage depending on the
                            hero
                            being played - and all semi-carries will scale at least moderately well with items. However,
                            by
                            the end of the middle game period, semi-carries typically transition into a more utility
                            role.
                            This is not to say that they play support; this is simply the point where their damage and
                            capabilities are outstripped by "hard" carries. To amend their damage "falling off" (as it
                            is
                            called), they often build items such as Heaven's Halberd, Assault Cuirass, and Scythe of
                            Vyse to
                            provide utility instead of their ailing damage.

                            Gankers are heroes with abilities that deliver long duration crowd control and/or immense
                            damage
                            in the early and midgame. They tend to have good mobility and rely on a mixture of physical
                            and
                            magical damage as well as disables to bring down their enemies. Their goal is to give the
                            team
                            an early game advantage during the laning phase by killing enemy heroes in their proper
                            lanes.
                            The ganker role is often synonymous with the semi-carry role, as most gankers become
                            semi-carries if they are successful in their efforts, owing to a large gold and level
                            advantage.
                            However, because their abilities do not scale as well, they will usually suffer more in the
                            late
                            game (hence the need for a hard carry). Nevertheless, if a ganker performs extremely well,
                            they
                            might prove to be the overall bigger threat to the enemy team at the game's conclusion than
                            an
                            allied hard carry. The most important task for a Ganker is to restrict the farm and levels
                            of
                            the opposing carry.

                            be the source of farm) and most crucially shutting down enemy junglers. They often attempt

                            gank the enemy's mid hero, a difficult feat (albeit a very rewarding one) which usually

                            Offlane heroes are those with abilities that allow them to solo the "suicide lane" (top lane
                            for
                            Radiant, bottom lane for Dire). Having an offlaner in a team's lineup allows the team to
                            also
                            have a Jungler or run a tri-lane with less risk of losing the suicide lane to the opposing
                            lane.
                            In many cases, the offlaner may have to forgo a great deal of farm in order to simply stay
                            alive, and as such may be on the back foot much of the time. Heroes with the ability to
                            escape
                            from certain death are best suited to this role, as the offlaner's first priority should be
                            to
                            not die in lane. Against skilled opponents, the offlaner may be extremely under-leveled
                            compared
                            to other heroes on the field, and as such it is generally unwise to put a hard carry in the
                            offlane because they may not get enough farm to obtain the items they need to snowball into
                            the
                            late-game.

                        game. This aspect is separate from the lanes that the hero begins in or amount of farm they get,

                                Heroes that push lanes are good at bursting down waves of creeps and moving quickly from
                                lane to lane (or attack a lane from across the map) in order to put pressure on the

                                towers forcing enemies to respond, potentially setting up ganking situations and at the

                                countered by lane de-pushers or ganking, since strong lane pushing heroes are often

                    Game modes are a set of restrictions within which the game of Doto 2 can be played. Most game modes
                    alter how heroes are picked by players. There are also some novelty modes that allow 1v1 play, or
                    give a
                    player a new hero every time they die, for example. Game modes are unlocked by increasing your
                    profile
                    level, with all modes being unlocked at level 10. In addition to standard game modes, Doto 2 also
                    supports Custom Games created by the community.

                            goal being to collect candy and to return it to your team's candy bucket. Candy can be

                            from Roshlings or neutral creeps, or stolen from enemy heroes or the enemy bucket. After

                            or feed him a piece of candy. When the first phase ends, the team with the most candy stored
