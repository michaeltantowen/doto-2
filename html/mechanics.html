        <p class="sub-desc">
          Doto 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game in which two teams of five players compete tcollectively destroy a large structure defended by the opposing team known as the "Ancient", whilst defendintheir own. As in Defense of the Ancients, the game is controlled using standard real-time strategy controls, anis presented on a single map in a three-dimensional isometric perspective. Ten players each control one of thgame's 121 playable characters, known as "heroes", with each having their own design, strengths, and weaknesseHeroes are divided into 5 primary roles, known as the mid laner, safe laner, off laner, soft support and harsupport.

          Each player controls a unique Hero out of a pool of 115. Unlike many other similar games, Dota 2 only allows there to be 1 of a specific hero in a game. Each hero has unique stats, Spells, and Talent Trees.  Heroes start at level 1 and max out at level 25. Every level until 19 grants a Skill Point which can be used to unlock or upgrade spells or add a branch to your Talent Tree.<br>
          A hero's stats include all basic elements of a hero and its attributes. The elements are the base: attack time, damage, HP, mana, armor, magic resistance, attributes, and move speed.  Attributes are the Strength, Agility, and Intelligence of the hero. Each hero has its own base attributes and attribute gain per level, and each attribute provides certain bonuses. Strength is HP, HP regen and magic resistance, Agility is attack speed, movement speed and armor, and Intelligence is mana pool, mana regen and spell damage amplification. Heroes are divided into overarching categories based on their "Primary Attribute." Heroes usually gain more of their primary attribute than the others, and each point of the primary attribute also gives the hero 1 attack damage. These factors means that Strength heroes are usually better at surviving damage (tanky), Intelligence heroes are more able to keep casting spells, and Agility heroes have great attack speed and armor.<br>
          A hero's abilities are the biggest part of its strengths and weaknesses, each with its own mana cost, cooldown, and effects. Most heroes has three basic spells and one Ultimate. As mentioned before, these spells are upgraded by skill points gained on level. Ultimate abilities, being the most powerful, can only be learned at level 6 and upgraded at levels 12 and 18.<br>
          Each hero also has a unique Talent Tree. At levels 10, 15, 20, and 25, two branches of the tree will unlock. When you choose one of the talents with a skill point, you gain its effects but miss out on the other talent. Effects vary widely, with some heroes able to pick up attack damage, HP, cast range, or even unique upgrades to their spells.  The talent tree is used to adapt to the way each specific game is going. For example, against a lineup consisting of physical damage dealers you may choose an armor talent over magic resistance.
          The combination of a hero's stats, attributes, spells, and talent tree gives that hero unique strengths, weaknesses, and optimal item choices. A good team composition has heroes that cover each other's weaknesses and complement each other's strengths, but such a discussion is beyond the scope of this guide.

          Ancient
          <br><br>
          Ancients (also known as Thrones) are massive structures and the main objective. Ancients have no offensive abilities, but are guarded by towers and powerful team of five heroes. The Ancient is invincible until both Tier 4 towers are destroyed.
          <br><br>
          Tower
          <br><br>
          Three towers are placed along each of the three "lanes" of the Doto map, with two outside the base and one defending the Barracks. Towers are a higher tier depending on how far they are in the lane. Every tower, except for Tier 1 towers, are invulnerable until the lower tier tower in front of it is destroyed. The two Tier 4 towers defending a team's Ancient become vulnerable if any Tier 3 tower is destroyed. Barracks do not have to be destroyed to make these towers vulnerable. Both Tier 4 towers must be destroyed in order to remove the Ancient's invulnerability. Higher tier means more armor, hp, and damage. In order to attack a tower or barracks, the previous tower must be destroyed first. Additionally, buildings aside from T1s gain "Backdoor Protection" while there are no enemy creeps nearby, granting them bonus armor and regenerating damage they take while in that state. This adds structure to pushing, as players will need creeps nearby to push.
          <br><br>
          Backdoor Protection
          <br><br>
          All buildings except for Tier 1 towers and the Fountain have backdoor protection, which regenerates structures by 90 hp per second until they are at their previous health amount, and provides 75% damage resistance against illusions and 40% damage resistance against all other units. 
          <br><br>
          Barracks
          <br><br>
          Barracks are buildings that spawn Lane Creeps and are defended by Tier 3 towers. There are two barracks for each lane. The Melee Barracks is always to the right and the Ranged Barracks is always to the left, no matter which faction's side of the map you are on.
          <br><br>
          Fountain
          <br><br>
          The fountain is a structure located in the respawn area of each base, and provides a healing and mana regeneration aura to all allied units near it.
          <br><br>
          Shrines
          <br><br>
          Shrines are buildings that can be activated 5 minutes into each match, to restore mana and HP to nearby heroes on a 5 minute cooldown. They are located outside the base, one in each of your faction's jungles. They are invulnerable until a T3 tower has fallen. 
          <br><br>
          Effigies/Pillars
          <br><br>
          Effigies are smaller structures that act as buffers within a base, making creeps take longer to reach actual towers and give the base's defenders more time to act. Invulnerable until a Tier 3 tower is destroyed.
