Chaos Knight is a melee strength hero with one of the highest physical damage output ceilings of all heroes. He is mostly played as a carry and ganker. As his name implies, he has a theme based on randomness and uncertainty. His regular attack has an incredibly wide thirty damage spread, making his last hitting ability somewhat unreliable.
