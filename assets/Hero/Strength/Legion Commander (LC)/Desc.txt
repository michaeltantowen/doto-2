Tresdin, the Legion Commander, is a melee strength hero fitting the role of carry. A highly mobile and somewhat tanky hero, her skillset and gameplay revolve mainly around killing off targets and especially backliners and supports, with her ultimate, Duel. Each successful Duel grants Tresdin permanent bonus damage. Though she is extremely skilled in "fair" one-on-one fights, Tresdin suffers when outnumbered and must choose her engagements carefully.
