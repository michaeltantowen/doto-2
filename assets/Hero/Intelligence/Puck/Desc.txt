Puck, the Faerie Dragon, is a highly mobile ranged intelligence hero best known for being an extremely unpredictable and slippery target. Puck is commonly played as an initiator and ganker, with spells such as Illusory Orb and Waning Rift that are equally useful for super-aggressive maneuvers as well as daring escapes, or using Dream Coil to create havoc and crowd control your enemies.
